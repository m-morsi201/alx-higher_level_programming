This is "0x0C. Python - Almost a circle" task. 
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain the following without the help of Google:

1. What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project.
2. How to serialize and deserialize a Class.
3. How to write and read a JSON file.
4. What is *args and how to use it.
5. What is **kwargs and how to use it.
6. How to handle named arguments in a function.
