This is my "0x14. JavaScript - Web scraping" project at ALX SE.
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain the following:

	1. Why JavaScript programming is amazing
	2. How to manipulate JSON data
	3. How to use request and fetch API
	4. How to read and write a file using fs module
