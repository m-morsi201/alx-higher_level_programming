This is my project "0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures" at ALX SE Program.
At the end of this project, I am  expected to be able to explain the following to anyone:

	1. How to create an object in JavaScript?
	2. What this means?
	3. What undefined means?
	4. Why the variable type and scope is important?
	5. What is a closure?
	6. What is a prototype?
	7. How to inherit an object from another?
	8. Why JavaScript programming is amazing?
